# vue-todo
Welcome to my personal project. The most clich√© idea yet! Building a todo application in vue! Wow, you must be thinking: What a creative guy! Well thank you for your thoughts. Looks can be deceiving, my guy. The idea is, however, to build a professional, releasable, cool and clean looking To-do application using Vue, Vuex and lots of other stuff. Probably... 

So just enjoy, fork it, or just criteque my code in a good ol' issue.
