## TOODS!

[] Create a view for the categories
  [] This view should let the user remove and edit categories
  [] This should maybe be a modal component?

[] Create a modal popup component for the alert boxes
  [] This component should appear when the user press delete on a list, or category

[] Create an error component that takes messages from failed fetch, promises etc.


## Drag to delete? 
[] This could be the standard shortcut to delete filters
[] When dragged, an icon appears to the right
[] When the item is above the icon and dropped it will trigger the alert component
